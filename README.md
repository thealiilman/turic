# Turic
A little Ruby script that fetches lyrics from [lyrics.ovh](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/), and prints the lyrics to the user who ran the script.

## Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/thealiilman/turic.git
cd turic
ruby turic.rb
```

It will ask you two questions. The first being the band name, the second being the name of the tune.  
Happy rock n roll AI x
